The user can also create an open challenge or a completed one.

## Daily Logger

This is the core purpose of the application, where the user can start a timer, and enter all the daily information as the coding challenge progresses and when finished. On the right side of the page, there are formatting of the information for both Twitter and Github in markdown format. Thus, with the click of a button, we can then just copy-paste and post on the appropriate platform.

## Daily Log History

The application also stores the daily logs to a database. Hence, the user can track his progress within a single place, and even edit past logs if there was a mistake when logging or simply if there are additions to be made.
